# SuperPaste

Have you ever found yourself in code, needing to send a large chunk of text, such as a log file, but didn't want to
clog up the chat with a wall of text? SuperPaste is here to help! SuperPaste is a simple, easy-to-use tool that allows
you to paste large chunks of text into a file, and then send a link to that file to your friends or coworkers. They can
then view the file in their browser, without having to download it.

This works by taking your desired files, such as a log string, and posting them to a chosen server, such as hst.sh
and mystb.in. The server will then return a link to the file, which you can then send to your friends.

it fell into disrepair, and had an ugly API.
